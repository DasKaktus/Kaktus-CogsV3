    Hello and welcome to the Aperture Science computer-aided enrichment center. The enrichment center consists of multiple chambers designed to challenge your puzzle solving skills, knowledge of cryptography and ability to find hidden messages. 

    To complete each chamber you must discover the command hidden within the puzzle to progress to the next chamber and receive the next puzzle. 

    All commands use the same basic format of "!Aperture-Science-" followed by a code/text string unique to that puzzle which is used to access the next puzzle.

    These puzzles use a variety of techniques from simple ciphers to more challenging methods of hiding messages.

    Good luck.
